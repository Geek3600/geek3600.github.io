I'm a Master's Student at the School of Computer Science, Fudan University in Shanghai. I received my Bachelor's degree in Communication Engieering from Xidian University in Xi'an in 2025. My current research focuses on Domain-Specific Architecture(DSA) and the design automation of specialized hardware accelerators.



 I'm always eager to learn and discuss new ideas in computer architecture and hardware acceleration. Feel free to connect!
